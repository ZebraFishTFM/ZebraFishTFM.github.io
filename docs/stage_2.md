In this stage, the system has found a valid connectivity of the mesh and cleaned up incorrectly detected markers. Additionally it has added points that were missed during the detection. The underlying algorithm is the same as in the previous Cellogram paper.

In case there were previously undetected points added, the button to move points appears. Move the points to their exact position by clicking and dragging them.

Most likely, it would simply say "Great! No vertex added" meaning your input image is of great quality.
