Although the force-generating machinery is known, it is unknown how tissues exert physical stresses on their substrate to generate motion in vivo. Here, we identify the force transmission machinery, the substrate, and the stresses that a tissue, the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, generates during its migration. We find that the primordium couples actin flow through integrins to the basement membrane for forward movement. Talin/integrin-mediated coupling is required for efficient migration and its loss is partly compensated for by increased actin flow. Using Embryogram, an approach to measure stresses in vivo, we show that the primordium\u2019s rear exerts high stresses, indicating that this tissue pushes itself forward with its back. This unexpected strategy likely also underlies the motion of other tissues in animals. Introduction \u00b6 The ZebraFish software package contains custom-developed software for the analysis of reference free 3D traction force images. The software comprises of 3D marker detection and finite element analysis in order to compute surface traction fields. Details on the underlying algorithms are provided in the supplementary information. The entire code is contained in src/ folder. The ZebraFish binary is in the binary/ folder (there is no need to compile the code). Requirements \u00b6 ZebraFish does not require any commercial software and was tested on Windows 10 Enterprise and Mac OS X 10.14. The executable is not signed, therefore on Mac it requires to enable the option to run untrusted applications. The simplest way is to right click on ZebraFish, select \u201copen\u201d and allow it to open in any subsequent dialogues. Note that you might need to allow running apps from not coming from the apple store. To do so, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy the General tab and click the App Store and identified developers radio button (this step requires admin priviledges).
